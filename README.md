<h2>About</h2>

This guide was written to accompany Dwarf Therapist, a player-made utility popular with players of the esoteric fortress-building game "Dwarf Fortress". I developed the initial version of this guide over the course of a few weeks in the summer of 2013 while studying the LaTeX typesetting language. The hope is that by making its source code publicly available we can solicit public imporvements to the text, as I don't have the time or commitment to maintain it to a high standard alone, except perhaps in summer months.

To minimize my incremental workload, the next overhaul will probably occur at the start of Splinterz's next development break, or once ToadyOne leaves bugfix land behind and begins work on his next major update.
