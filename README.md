Dwarf Therapist Guide Version 23.1
========

Guide written to accompany Dwarf Therapist, a player-made utility popular with players of the esoteric world-guilding game
"Dwarf Fortress".

I developed the initial version of this guide over the course of a few weeks in the summer of 2013 while studying the LaTeX
typesetting language. The hope is that by making its source code publicly available we can solicit public imporvements to
the text, as I don't have the time or commitment to maintain it to a high standard alone.
